👋🏼 Hello...world? Maybe that too cliche. In anycase welcome to my blog, CantScript. 

I'm the type of person that thinks `"wouldn't it be great if I could do..."` but then never really know how to make it happen becuase I don't really think I can script (get the name now?). However, in **some** way shape or form I tend to get things to work in weird and crazy ways. 

So I'd like to share some of my thoughts and ideas with you here. 

If you're looking for **Apple** and **Jamf** focused content with a lean towards **Education** then you are in the right place.

Hit me up on slack or linkedIn if you want to get in touch 🐜
