I've been toying with the idea of creating a blog for a little while. At some point last year I decided to get the domain `cantscript.com` with the thought of next step blog and then didn't. 

I have since then however embraced the moniker of **CantScript** on GitHub and MacAdmins Slack. 

Shall we start with that? Why go be **CantScript**?

Well its a bit tongue in check but at the same time, if you were to aks me to my face I would tell you 

_"I can't script. I have all these ideas of what would be cool but mostly have no confidence that I could script anything to get the idea across the line"_

I still stand by that but as it turns out, its not all about scripting is it. In a day and age of MDM its all about profiles and payload too...just to add to the complexities. Once again, if you'd ask me i'd reply with

_"well, I think it works this way but I'm not sure if doing it that way would work"_

Even so, I'm a trier and more often than not I find a way to get something of the ground and working. Even if by most peoples standing it held together with tape. 

And that there is what I'd like the very point of this blog to be. I want to share things that I've struggled with or might not know and make it easier for the next person. Might it be the best way? Nope, likely not in fact! but if it gets somebody else from A to B quicker than it did me and they can improve on it, then I'd say I've done what I set out to do. 

There is then a second point that I'd like to bring up...

As mentioned on the home page, this blog will be focused on **Apple** and **Jamf** and my background has been in the **Education** sphere. As such as have developed a specialism in **Jamf School** but if you are here already, you likely know this. 

So expect that most posts here will be all about Jamf School, Jamf School workflows and cool things to when working with Jamf School.

There we have it, my fist post so that theres something here when I heopfuly actually publish this blog to the big ol'interwebs.
