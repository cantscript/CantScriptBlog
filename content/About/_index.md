Hello! My name is Anthony but people only really call me Anthony when I'm in trouble, so you can me Ant 😁

This is my personal blog where i'll be writing about and sharing things I figure out that I think others might feel useful too. It'll be Apple related, it'll be Jamf related and more specifcally it'll often be Jamf School related

I've been working in and around the Apple world since from 2010ish. I acutally kind of fell into into and started working in an Apple Premium Reseller right after finishing Uni _(Thats where I feel in love with Apple while studying Music Tech)_.

This was a part time gig at first and then moved up to store manager before moving on to the Education Sales team. Yep, thats right, the sales team!

An Apple partner or two and a few years later I moved into a technical role. Being a education focused reseller I spent a lot of time deploying Apple devices using Jamf and what was at the time Zuludesk. 

<br>

A few more years after that I found myself at Jamf and just so happened that so did Zuludesk! At Jamf, Im a Consulting Engineer with a focus on Education and have become somewhat of a specilist in Jamf School.....even if I do say so myself 😂

Due to this and my long standing focus and interaction with Education customers, you'll find that this blog will include Jamf School heavily. This might be the only blog that'll be "Jamf School First" 🤷🏼‍♂️

However you found yourself here, I hope that you find something here thats interesting or useful.
